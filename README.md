# CarryBuddy
This project will come in 3 seperate phases:
  Phase 1: Movement
  Phase 2: GPS Tracking and following
  Phase 3: Better Intelligence, and weight distribution mechanics.
  
The point of this project is so that I can get something to carry my belongings and follow me through countless obstacles. My main goals that I have for this is that it should be able to go upstairs, drive on heavy terrain, is weather resistant, and is quickly able to maneuver through situtations that could hit it head on immediately. This project is still on it's very early newborn stages. But I hope to finish Phases 2 and 3 by next year, Spring of 2024.
